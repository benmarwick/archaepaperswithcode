# Twitter bot posting new archaeology papers that include R code

This twitter bot runs from a simple R script. When our list of archaeology papers with R code is updated, the script posts a tweet with details of the new paper. 

The bot tweets at https://twitter.com/archaepaperswithcode

## How this works

To make this work, a Twitter App needs to be generated with elevated access to the V2 API (read and write) - apply for access from essential after generation. Once you have set up the twitter account, you need to set the 4 keys referred to in the R script as secrets in the github repo settings.
